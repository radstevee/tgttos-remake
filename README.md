# To Get To The Other Side!
This is my remake of the MC Championship game with the title above.

This is a 1.19.4 Plugin, to use it, you can download the whole server files,
or just download the jar and world, and do your own stuff with it.

# Usage
- /startgame - This is used to start the Game.
- /stopgame - This is used to stop the Game, which still has to be used after finish.
- /colour - You can change your block colour with this.

The Skydive map was not built by me, but by [MickeyKat](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/mickeykat/) on PlanetMinecraft. The whole map can be found [here](https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/tgttos-skydive-practise-map/).
