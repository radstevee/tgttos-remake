# Maps

IMPORTANT: The maps were not built by me.

- [Skydive](https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/tgttos-skydive-practise-map/) was built
  by [MickeyKat](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/mickeykat/)
- [Walls](https://www.planetminecraft.com/project/tgttos-walls/) was also built
  by [MickeyKat](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/mickeykat/)

Please check out [MickeyKat](https://www.planetminecraft.com/member/mickeykat/), he builds these maps and even makes
them work with custom datapacks.

I just modified some bits here and there, so please don't credit me for the map but rather the plugin if you showcase
it.
